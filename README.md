DoughRise Mobile Developer Intern Challenge
Hey there!

I'm excited to share my experience with the DoughRise Mobile Developer Intern Challenge. It was an opportunity for me to showcase my skills and demonstrate my ability to implement a functional front-end for a portion of the app. Let me walk you through the details!

Challenge Description
The challenge revolved around creating the Home Page module of the DoughRise app, specifically focusing on the budget breakdown section. This module allows users to manage their budget and track their spending across different categories. Our task was to bring this page to life using SwiftUI or UIKit, following the provided Figma design assets.

Challenge Highlights
The challenge had several key elements:

Implementation: I had to implement the Home Page module, with a specific focus on the budget breakdown section.
Design Assets: The provided Figma designs served as a guide throughout the implementation process, ensuring the final result matched the desired look and feel.
Budget Breakdown Bar: I made sure the budget breakdown bar accurately reflected the allocated budgets for each category.
Transaction Functionality: I added the functionality to add transactions to each category, enabling users to track their spending effectively.
Category Creation: To illustrate the feature, I created a range of 3-8 categories, closely aligning with the design guidelines.
Design Assets
Working with the provided Figma designs was a great experience. They provided clear direction on the visual aspects of the Home Page module and allowed me to maintain design consistency throughout the implementation process.

Final Submission
To showcase my work, I recorded a screen recording demonstrating the functional feature in action, including the process of adding transactions. I also provided access to my codebase by sharing a Git repository containing all the relevant files.

Evaluation Criteria
During the review process, the DoughRise team assessed various aspects of the implementation:

UI/UX Attention-to-Detail: I made sure my implementation closely matched the provided Figma designs, paying meticulous attention to the user experience.
Communication Abilities: I documented my codebase thoroughly, explaining any design decisions and providing clarity on the overall structure and functionality.
Code Documentation Skills: I utilized appropriate code comments and documentation to enhance the readability and understandability of my code.
Conclusion
Participating in the DoughRise Mobile Developer Intern Challenge was an enriching experience. It allowed me to demonstrate my technical skills and showcase my ability to create a functional front-end for a real-world application. I'm grateful for this opportunity and eagerly await the team's feedback.

Thank you for considering my application!

Best regards,
